To launch the bot, you should do few more steps:

1. Download the libraries: discord.py; python-dotenv; easy-pil.
2. Create the ".env" file together with bot.py, so bot.py can access it, then, in your environment file, copy and paste this: DISCORD_TOKEN="(Your token goes here)", where you should put your discord bot token in quotes. (Without parenthesis)
3. In the bot.py, line 36, put your channel id in the quotes. Do the same in the cogs/level.py; line 51
4. Go to the main.py and run the bot.
